- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechnoGoku
- 👀 I'm interested in electronic and other music, anime, manga, videogames, human communication, information absorption, personal growth and programming. Programming has become my new hobby, so I want to excel in it.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python and want to learn HTML and CSS in the future, and who knows, maybe other programming languages as well.
- 💞️ I don't have a lot of experience, for collaborating with someone, but in the future, as I develop, I wouldn't mind doing interesting things with someone :)
- 📫 How to reach me: https://t.me/drain_gaang
- 😄 Pronouns: I am a man 😎
- ⚡ Fun fact: in addition to being a programmer, I want to be a DJ 😎🎧.
